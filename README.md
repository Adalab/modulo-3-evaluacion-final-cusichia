# Harry Potter React Project

This was my first project built with React. The main goal was to fetch data from an API, filter the characters, and display them dynamically.

## Features

- Fetches Harry Potter character data from an external API.
- Filters characters to make searching easier.
- Uses `Routes` and `Route` for navigation between the character list and individual character detail pages.
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Implements dark and light modes inspired by the spells *Lumos* (light mode) and *Nox* (dark mode).

This project helped me get familiar with essential React concepts, routing, state management, and responsive styling.
